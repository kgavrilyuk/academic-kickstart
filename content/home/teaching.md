I was a teaching assistant for the following courses at the University of Amsterdam:

- [Deep Learning, 2016](http://uvadlc.github.io/)
- [Deep Learning, 2017](https://deeplearningamsterdam.github.io/)
- [Information Visualization, 2017](https://github.com/kgavrilyuk/UvA-InfoVis-2017-Students)

I also co-supervised two BSc theses:
